# [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker)
This is the last project of my back-end & APIs certification at FreeCodeCamp.
It was very challenging, and I've learned a lot by doing it.

I know I probably can refactor my code to be more efficient at some points.
For many users (millions, maybe) I should implement more sofisticated data sctructures.
But for now this works. In future projects, when I build a complete CRUD application, I will implement a more sofisticated solution.
